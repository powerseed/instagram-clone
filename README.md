This is a **UI clone** of Instagram. It is deployed at https://instagram-clone-delta-flame.vercel.app/

It is ongoing. By now I have finished the Home page. In the future I will finish all pages as well as using a database instead of rendering static data and images.

To run it locally:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Visit the URL shown in the console. For example, `http://localhost:3000/`
