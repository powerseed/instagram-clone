This is a **UI clone** of Instagram. It is deployed at https://instagram-clone-delta-flame.vercel.app/

It is ongoing. So far I have basically finished the UI, next I will make it fullstack.

Technologies used:

1. Next.js
2. Typescript
3. Tailwind CSS

To run it locally:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Visit the URL shown in the console. For example, `http://localhost:3000/`
